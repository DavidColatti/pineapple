# Project _Pineapple_

This project allows developer candidates to display their ability to deliver clean
and usable code using AngularJS or Angular (version 7) in a timely manner. Candidates will receive feedback on their coding
style, substance, and completeness following the exercise. If you choose to use a modern version of Angular, please refer to [this Repository](https://github.com/mobi/pineapple-ng6).

## Preparation

- [ ] Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your
development machine
- [ ] Fork this project into your personal Github repository
- [ ] Review the project's file structure to prepare for tackling deliverables
- [ ] From the command line, traverse into the project's root folder and type `npm install`
- [ ] After installation completes, type `npm start` and [open a browser window to view the
project](localhost:8080)

## Deliverables

- [ ] Add a search filter for the table of device data. The user should be able to type a string of
text and see the collection of devices update in real time.
- [ ] All tests should pass when executing `npm test` on the command line
- [ ] After you've completed your work, send us a link to your remote repository along with a _brief_ overview of your solution.

## Bonus Deliverable

Feel free to use your creativity to provide any additional functionality and we would happily review that as well.
